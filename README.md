# Blog App

### About
This is a full-featured blog application built using the MERN Stack. It allows users to create, share, and explore blog posts within a vibrant community. The project was developed using React (Vite.js) for the front-end, Node.js (Express) for the back-end, and MongoDB for the database. You can register, follow other users, share blog posts, read posts shared by others, leave comments, and save posts to your bookmarks.
